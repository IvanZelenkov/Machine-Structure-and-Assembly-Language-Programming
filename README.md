This course provides fundamental understanding of programming a
computer hardware by teaching a low-level programming language, known
as the assembly language programming. Assembly language structures,
operators, macros and directives are covered. The hardware context is
based on Intel and AMD processors and their architectures. The course
teaches better manipulation of the hardware using assembly language
programming; teaches real versus protected mode programming,
interaction between assembly language and operation systems as well as
application programs. The course also teaches, how to use assembly
language to develop system level efficient software modules.
